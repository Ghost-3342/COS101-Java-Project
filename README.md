This is a pretty simple java program for a any appointment based service businesses to  easily be able to keep track of bookings by typing in the client's information and having the program print everything to a .txt file.

The program uses the Jcalender library, and it needs to be downloaded and added to the lib folder, and then program will run.
I have included my lib folder as a zip file because i had issues with uploading unzipped, so all you will need to do it download all the files into a project folder that you have already created, and unzip the lib folder into the directory.

This project was originally built for a uni assignment.
