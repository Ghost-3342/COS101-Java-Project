Sip Safari
Project vision: 
Sip Safari is an all-inclusive wine tasting booking system where users can book and pay for themselves or as groups for wine tastings, lunch, dinner, and tours of the Cape Town wine farm. The wine farm will be able to see and manage all bookings made, in case of an emergency, and prepare accordingly for guests. Users that book evening tastings/tours can book rooms when they arrive should they wish to spend the night in the magical farm.
